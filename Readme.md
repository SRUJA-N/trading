Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:
* Node.js (which includes npm)

2.  **Set Up the Backend:**
    * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    * Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python -m venv my_env
        source my_env/Scripts/activate or ./my_env/Scripts/Activate # On Windows
        ```
    * Install the required Python packages:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    * Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```

3.  **Set Up the Frontend:**

        ```
    * Install the required Node.js packages:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

### Running the Application

You will need two terminals running simultaneously.

1.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    * In your backend terminal (with the venv active) (my_env) PS C:\Users\hp\Desktop\test\Project-Paper-Trading\backend>, run:
        ```bash
        uvicorn main:app --reload
        ```
    * The backend will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Server:**
    * In your front/src terminal, run:
        ```bash
        cd front/src 
        npm run dev
        ```
    * The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
